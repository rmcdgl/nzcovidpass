# Go NZ COVID Pass decoder


A Go library for decoding and verifying [NZ COVID Pass](https://github.com/minhealthnz/nzcovidpass-spec)

As the NZ COVID Pass spec is very similar to the EU Digital COVID Certificate, this library is adapted from [`stapelberg/coronaqr`](https://github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr)


# TODO

- tests
- example of usage
- parse `https://nzcp.covid19.health.nz/.well-known/did.json` for certificates rather than hardcoded string
